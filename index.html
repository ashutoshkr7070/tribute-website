            <h1>Learnings from David Goggins Life ::-</h1>
            <li>Don't just get motivated. Get obsessed. Motivation fades, but obsession pulls you through difficult
                odds.</li>
            <li>Be your own hero, and be uncommon in your own world. You can be "uncommon" in being a parent, a teacher,
                or someone working in a company.</li>
            <li>Callous your Mind by Making Uncomfortable Choices. Chase pain in one domain, and learn to see through
                it, to be able to conquer pain elsewhere in life.</li>
            <li>Earn your place every day. Never get complacent. You always have something to prove â€” to yourself.</li>
            <li>Embrace being "The Other". Being uncommon means being different. Which can only mean good!</li>
            <li>Conquer other people's minds (and "take their souls"). Leapfrog others' expectations of you, shocking
                them, so they are at a loss how to dominate you.</li>
            <li>Run your own race, and don't let others dictate your reality. You're only competing against yourself.
            </li>
            <li>Think about others, and lead from the front. Help others, and your own burden will become much lighter.
            </li>
            <li>Accept your flaws and triple down on them. Stare at yourself in the mirror and think: how can I improve?
            </li>
            <li>Dip into the Cookie Jar of Past Victories. Keep note of times you succeeded. Remember them as
                inspiration for how you'll succeed again.</li>
            <li>Surround yourself with your champions. Be inspired constantly!</li>
            <li>Remove the "Governor" within yourself, because it's holding you to 40% of your potential. When you think
                you're done and can go no longer... you're not even halfway at your full potential.</li>
